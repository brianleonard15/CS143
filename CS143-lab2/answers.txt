	I used a random eviction policy - I get the keys of all the pages in my buffer pool and choose a random one to flush and remove. I chose random because it was the easiest to implement. Join required iterating through an inner and outer table, and concatenating the two tuples only after comparing the fields of the two tuples. IntegerAggregator.java and StringAggregator.java uses a HashMap to count the number fields in a group. IntegerAggregator.java also uses a HashMap to store the correct aggregate according to the operator. 

	As far as I know, all the code is complete and all the unit tests and system tests pass.

	I spent about 3 nights on the project, so I would guess roughly 13 hours plus or minus 3. I had trouble because I was passing all the unit tests, but was not passing the EvictionTest, which was far more difficult to debug. I also ended up having to rewrite some of FileIterator because it was failing in a lot of places due to poor implementation previously.
